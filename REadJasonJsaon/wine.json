        "notes": "Mason has been going to CrossFit and it shows. No whiskers yet but his 2015 vintage has more serious character, complexity and muscle than ever. Redolent with deeply ripened berries, baker's chocolate, cola, and cedary oak spice the wine is concentrated and rich on entry. Picking up notes of caf\u00e9 latte toward the finish, a network of sinewy yet supple tannins provides a platform for this bulked up wine. "

        "notes": "Crafted from a combination of Oak Knoll vines and longer-hanging Carneros clusters, our 2008 Napa Valley Chardonnay is satisfyingly ripe, yet focused and fresh in the same sip. Showy stone fruit, pear, hazelnut and toasty oak spices spill from the glass. Rich-bodied, fruitful and round on the palate with vanilla and subtle minerality, the wine is threaded with lively acidity bringing length and focus to a fine finish."

        "notes": "Our 2000 Reserve Cabernet is a beautiful, showy wine, spilling-over with spicy oak and aromatic cedar, centered on opulent black fruit. Absolutely rich, ripe and round, we used 90% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Cabernet Franc and 3% Merlot in this Reserve blend. A cloak of vanilla, clove and seductive oak spice wraps around a deeply fruited core of currant and wild berries with hints of anise and chocolate that gradually give way to long, mouth-coating tannins. 2,300 cases produced.

        "notes": "Our Sonoma Chardonnay comes from some of the oldest Dutton Ranch plantings in Russian River. These vines consistently yield fruit of great complexity and intensity seldom found in other sites. Cooler temperatures toward the end of the 2008 growing season resulted in crisp, well-defined flavors and long ripening times. Ripe citrus, Tupelo honey and sweet floral notes combined with seductive oak and all-spice aromas are just the beginning. Sun-ripened citrus fruit flavors are framed with brilliant acidity giving this wine its trademark zest and tremendous length."
